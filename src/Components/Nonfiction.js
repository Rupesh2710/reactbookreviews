            <p><b>Author: </b>Dr. Karan Ranjan</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Though the odds are stacked against us, the human body has an extraordinary tendency to survive...

                THE DANGERS OF PLUCKING YOUR NOSE HAIRS

                YOUR UNTAPPED NATURAL REFLEXES TO COMBAT STRESS

                HOW TO MANAGE PAIN WITH SIMPLE MIND TRICKS

                AND WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER HOLD IN A FART</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>
                This has to be the most fun non fiction I've ever read. Dr. Karan ranjan is a surgeon and senior clinical lecturer in England who is quite popular on social media.
                I've been following him for a long time and love his videos. So when I got to know that he's writing a book I knew I has to read it and I'm glad I did. A lot of cool facts about human body. I have a lot more respect for my asshole after reading this book.
                And this book is the reason why I'll most likely never take my phone in toilet again. NEVER!.

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyAm8EIIidb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Forgotten Highlander</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Alastair Urquhart</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Alistair Urquhart was a soldier in the Gordon Highlanders captured by the Japanese in Singapore.
                He not only survived working on the notorious Bridge on the River Kwai ,
                but he was subsequently taken on one of the Japanese 'hellships' which was torpedoed. Nearly everyone else on board died and Urquhart spent 5 days alone on a raft in the South China Sea before being rescued by a whaling ship.
                He was taken to Japan and then forced to work in a mine near Nagasaki. Two months later a nuclear bomb dropped just ten miles away
                . . .This is the extraordinary story of a young men, conscripted at nineteen and whose father was a Somme Veteran, survived not just one, but three close encounters with death
                - encounters which killed nearly all his comrades.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>This book fascinated me. And scared me. How can someone go through so much and stay alive. I can't even imagine the amount of grit and mental strength someone must have to do that.
                After reading this book it turned out I didn't know a lot of things about world war 2 because they aren't talked about as much as they should.
                If you are interested in reading true stories related to world war 2 then I highly recommend it.</p>

            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>Reading a book on mental health written by a clinical psychologist was a fascinating experience.
                I got to know a lot of stuff like why telling people to "Just think positively " wouldn't really work, why there is a problem with setting "I just want to be happy " as your life goal.
                Why running away from fear and anxiety will make it worse, what is mindfulness and it's benefits, etc. Would definitely recommend this.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClGdsJlILGM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Talking With Serial Killers</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Christopher Berry-Dee</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Christopher Berry-Dee is the man who talks to serial killers. A world-renowned investigative criminologist, he has gained the trust of murderers across the world, entered their high security prisons, and discussed in detail their shocking crimes. The killers' pursuit of horror and violence is described through the unique audiotape and videotape interviews which Berry-Dee conducted, deep inside the bowels of some of the world's toughest prisons. Christopher Berry-Dee has collated these interviews into this astounding, disturbing book, which, since its first publication, has gone on to become a True Crime classic. Not only does he describe his meetings with some of the world's most evil men and women, he also reproduces, verbatim, their very words as they describe their crimes, allowing the reader a glimpse into the inner workings of the people who have committed the worst crime possible- to mercilessly take the life of another human being.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>"The human meat,well,ah,it tastes like pork... I don't know why I ate parts of people, but i just did".  An absolute blood chilling book. Some of these guys make ted bundy look like a friendly neighbor.</p>
