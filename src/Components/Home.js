                This place is all about books. So let me go into more detail
            </p>
            <p>
                I started reading books in 2021. And fell
                in love with them ever since. Started with nonfiction, then got into thrillers. After that explored
                classics, science fiction,romance,etc.

            <p>
            You're at a right place if you want someone
            to recommend you some amazing books. And also you can recommend me some great books if you want to.
            </p>
