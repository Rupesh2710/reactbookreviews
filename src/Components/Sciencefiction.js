            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw-VEpno2Aq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Project Hail Mary</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Andy Weir</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.

                Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.

                All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

                His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

                And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone.

                Or does he?</p>

                <p><b>My thoughts: </b>This is the 3rd Science fiction I've read and this one's a bit different. 
                It's the first time I read a book with a story set in space and this book has more Science than previous scifies I've read, which was really interesting. 
                This book should be made into a movie by a director like Ridley Scott or Dennis Villeneuve. 
                I'll 100 % recommend this book if you want to get into scifi and don't mind getting nerdy while reading a book.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl6UqqUoJZ6/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dark Matter</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Blake Crouch</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Jason Dessen has been abducted. His life has been stolen. To get it back, he will go on a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could have possibly imagined. Dark Matter is a relentlessly surprising alternate-universe sci-fi thriller from Blake Crouch. 'Are you happy in your life?' Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious. Before he awakes to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before the man he's never met smiles down at him and says, 'Welcome back.' In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible. In this other life, Jason has created a box. Transport into infinite alternate universes – every possible outcome of his life, one behind each door. In this other life, Jason chose a door. And he stole the life he wanted. If Jason Dessen wants his life back, he will have to find it among infinite possibilities. And he will have to battle a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>It was my first ever scifi novel and what a read it was. Understanding the concepts of quantum superposition and multiverse was really fun. I was hooked from the start.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm3UAIhIQEa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Recursion</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Blake Crouch</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>At first, it looks like a disease. An epidemic that spreads through no known means, driving its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.But the force that’s sweeping the world is no pathogen. It’s just the first shockwave, unleashed by a stunning discovery – and what’s in jeopardy is not just our minds.In New York City, Detective Barry Sutton is closing in on the truth – and in a remote laboratory, neuroscientist Helena Smith is unaware that she alone holds the key to this mystery . . . and the tools for fighting back.Together, Barry and Helena will have to confront their enemy – before they, and the world, are trapped in a loop of ever-growing chaos.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>Immediately bought it after reading dark matter and what an exciting read it was. Was about to finish it yesterday but couldn't.Never thought anyone could write such an fascinating shit on the concepts of memory. Last few chapters were so intense. My second blake crouch book and i'm looking forward to read more from the author.</p>
