            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg-4d7IpOmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Metamorphosis</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Franz Kafka</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>As Gregor Samsa awoke
                one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying
                on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike
                brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position
                and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of
                his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>This was the first ever
                claasic i read and I realised why franz kafka is so revered. What a beautiful piece of art this book is.
                Kafkahad a tumultous relationship with his father and this book somewhat reflects it. Even if it's fiction

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpxEXkDJfId/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Animal Farm</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>George Orwell</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>A farm is taken over by
                its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a
                paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric
                fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution
                against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>This book is a
                masterpiece. George orwell's 1984 is more popular but i like animal farm more. It's my
                favorite classic so far. It takes a nice jibe on communism</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiepMNqJGzJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Agatha Christie</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Roger Ackroyd knew too much. He knew that the woman he loved had poisoned her brutal first husband.
                He suspected also that someone had been blackmailing her. Now, tragically, came the news that she had taken her own life with a drug overdose.

                But the evening post brought Roger one last fatal scrap of information.
                Unfortunately, before he could finish the letter, he was stabbed to death</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>This was my introduction to great agatha christie and boy that was brilliant.
                Kept me guessing and all my guesses were wrong. Never got bored while reading it.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjfYLh4s9Xn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Murder on the Orient Express</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Agatha Christie</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer.
                An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.

                Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer in case he or she decides to strike again.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>My second christie book. Inspiration for a johnny depp movie.
                Loved it even more than roger ackroyd. Agatha christie is truly one of her kind.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsopKrCI9c2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Old Man and Sea</a></h1>
            <p><b>Author: </b>Ernest Hemingway</p>
            <p><b>Discription: </b>For old man Santiago, catching the biggest Marlin in the deep sea has become an obsession.
                But even after 84 days at sea, the deprived old man is unable to break the bad luck that seems to be following him around.
                While the whole village of fishermen has given up on him, it’s only his young Apprentice, Manolin, who supports his passion, but he too is forbidden by his parents to accompany the old man into the sea.The 85th day changes everything.
                Alone, for the next three days, Santiago fights with the forces of nature and with the shortcomings on by his old age in search of the great catch.
                One of Ernest Hemingway best works, the old man and the sea, explores the themes of mortality, honour-in-defeat and man’splace nature.</p>
            <p><b>My thoughts: </b>Afte reading franz kafka,agatha christie, George orwell and oscar wilde when it comes to classics, I figured out that i haven't read ernest hemingway yet.
                Given his immense reputation and respect people have for his work I had to give his work a try.
                This is my shortest book so far and it's hard to believe that a novel that's not even 100 pages made me feel so many things. This book might seem slow at the start but it becomes so much better afterwards.
                For me it was page 30 where it became really amazing.</p>
