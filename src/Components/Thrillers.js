                Archer arrives in the dusty Southern town of Poca City. He has nothing
                but a handful of dollars, the clothes he’s wearing and an appointment with his new parole officer. After his
                wartime experiences in Italy and a prison sentence for a crime he didn’t commit, Archer is looking for a
                fresh start and a peaceful life.On his first night of freedom, Archer meets local business tycoon Hank
                Pittleman, who promises Archer handsome compensation to work as his debt collector. Yet Archer takes on more
                than he bargains for, as he becomes embroiled in a long-running feud between the drought-struck town’s most
                dangerous residents. When one of them dies, the authorities label Archer as their number one suspect.A
                bloody game is being played above and below the law. Everybody playing has a deeply buried secret, and
                Archer must uncover them all if he’s to avoid going back behind bars.

                <b>My thoughts: </b>Aloysius archer is a
                really cool character. I liked the way dialogs were written in this book . I absolutely loved the second
                half of the book because of how new twists and turns just kept coming up.

                <b>Discription: </b>Alicia Berenson’s life
                is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand
                house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband
                Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never
                speaks another word.

                Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far
                grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her
                art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a
                secure forensic unit in North London.

                Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia.
                His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a
                twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....

            <p>
                <b>Discription: </b>Lowen Ashleigh is a
                struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy
                Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in
                a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.

                Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to
                find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an
                unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling
                admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.

                Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already
                grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she
                could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured
                wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.

                <b>My thoughts: </b>This book is the 2nd
                colleen hoover book I read. I'm scared to read her books because of verity. Not because it's a bad book. But
                because it has raised my standards so much that i'm scared if any one of her books will be upto my
                expectations. An engaging fast paced thriller.

                <b>My thoughts: </b>First 150-200 pages of this book were slower than I wanted them to be.
                Last 150 pages were way more fun then I expected them to be.
                This book requires patience of the reader to get to the interesting parts and for me that patience wasn't worthless at all. But I still like the first book of the series more than this book, because that one wasn't slow at any point IMO.
                Thrillers by authors like john Grisham, Jeffery archer and david baldacci are so different than popular Thrillers on internet ( the silent patient, housemaid, etc), i've read both kind of thrillers, they are a bit old school and a goldmine for someone who likes that. But they are not for everyone especially when it comes to young readers u think. I'm definitely going to read the third book of this series.

                <b>Discription: </b>The case is closed. Five years ago, schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by Sal Singh.
                The police know he did it. Everyone in town knows he did it. Almost everyone. Having grown up in the small town that was consumed by the crime, Pippa Fitz-Amobi chooses the case as the topic for her final project.
                But when Pip starts uncovering secrets that someone in town desperately wants to stay hidden, what starts out as a project begins to become Pip's dangerous reality . . .

                <b>My thoughts: </b>(Spoiler Alert) It was a light hearted read unlike other thrillers that I've read which i found interesting. Won't be for every thriller lover's taste. I like the structure of this book.
                The way interviews and pip's logs were printed in this book gave me a nice feeling while reading this book and kept me engaged. However there were some things I think could've been better.
                The scene when pip finds Andy bell at eliot's house and she figures out thar that girl is not real Andy, I think there should've been little more of that. More conversations between pip and that girl.
                More about thar girl's history through her own mouth,etc. And the fight between pip and Becca could've been better. May be it's coming from me loving super action packed gory stuff in fiction.
                Overall I liked it but I won't put this book in the same echelons as The silent patient and Verity.

                <b>Discription: </b>He's America's most brilliant president ever. He's also a psychopath.

                US president Keegan Barrett swept into office on his success as director of the CIA. Six months into his first term, he devises a clandestine power grab with a deadly motive: Revenge.

                President Barrett personally orders Special Agents Liam Grey and Noa Himel to execute his plan, but their loyalties are divided. As CIA agents they've sworn to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all threats, both foreign and domestic.

                When the threat comes directly from the Oval Office, that's where the blowback begins.

                <b>My thoughts: </b>In first 170 -180 pages there were a lot of things, they were ok.
                After that for the next 170-180 pages things started getting interesting as everything started connecting.
                And the last 150 pages were BRILLIANT. If you have patience, you won't be disappointed.
                I really liked the short chapters in this book.

                <b>Discription: </b>Oliver Marks has just served ten years for the murder of one of his closest friends – a murder he may or may not have committed.
                On the day he’s released, he’s greeted by the detective who put him in prison.
                Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he does, he wants to know what really happened ten years ago.
                As a young actor studying Shakespeare at an elite arts conservatory, Oliver noticed that his talented classmates seem to play the same roles onstage and off – villain, hero, tyrant, temptress – though Oliver felt doomed to always be a secondary character in someone else’s story.
                But when the teachers change up the casting, a good-natured rivalry turns ugly, and the plays spill dangerously over into life. When tragedy strikes, one of the seven friends is found dead. The rest face their greatest acting challenge yet: convincing the police, and themselves, that they are blameless.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>My thoughts: </b>It was quite a fascinating read for me. It is focused on young actors studying shakespere hence there are a lot of shakespere references.
                I wish I was more familiar with shakespere's work. I would enjoy this book even more if I was. Nevertheless, I found it pretty good. It's ending was crazy.
                If you are a bardolator, this book is made for you.

                I'm definitely looking forward to reading more dark academia books.

                Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I like.
                Every day I clean the Winchesters' beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.

                I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how Andrew, her husband, seems more broken every day.
                But as I look into Andrew's handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it's hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina's life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.
                I soon learn that the Winchesters' secrets are far more dangerous than my own...

                I try on one of Nina's pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it's like. But she soon found out...and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it's far too late.

                I reassure myself though: the Winchesters don't know who I really am.

                They don't know what I'm capable of...
